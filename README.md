## Hi, I'm Sumit Chachadi!

I'm an Observability Engineer by profession, currently based in Bangalore, Karnataka. Over the past decade, I’ve lived in Belgaum, Mangalore, Raleigh, and Buffalo, soaking in diverse cultures and experiences along the way.

I’m passionate about programming and enjoy building small projects in my free time. Beyond the keyboard, I’m a hobby photographer with a keen eye for landscapes and long exposures. And yes, I absolutely love baking sourdough!

These days, life is a bit busier (and a lot messier) as I spend most of my time with my newborn, embracing the joys and chaos of parenthood.

Welcome to my little corner of the internet!

Oh btw, you can see my portfolio here: [www.sumitmcc.com](https://sumitmcc.com)


Fun fact: I’ve experienced some of nature’s most dramatic moods – from earthquakes and hurricanes to blizzards, snowstorms, and hailstorms.
